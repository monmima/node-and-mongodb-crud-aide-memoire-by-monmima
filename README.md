# node-and-mongodb-barebone-example

This is a minimalistic yet quite complete example of a CRUD app with Node.js and MongoDB.

Doing this exercice helped me wrap my head around how to have Node.js and MongoDB interact with one another.

# The starting point

The starting point for this exercise was Programming Mentor's tutorial. The final result is now quite different this.

Thank you, Programming Mentor!
