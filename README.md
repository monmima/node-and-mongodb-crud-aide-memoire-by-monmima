# node-and-mongodb-barebone-example

This is a simple yet complete example of a CRUD app using HTML, Node.js and MongoDB.

Doing this exercice helped me wrap my head around how to have HTML, Node.js and MongoDB interact with one another all at the same time. It is also meant as a model and an ***aide-m√©moire*** for myself, for future projects.

The other reason why I created this is I couldn't find a similar tool for learning. The information I was able to gather was often fragmented or too complex (trying to teach EJS, MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose all at the same time, for instance). [Programming Mentor](http://programmingmentor.com/post/save-form-nodejs-mongodb/) is one of the few who has done something similar, but his material is now outdated.

## EJS: You don't want to learn it for now? No problem!

There are a few pages of the site/app using EJS.

If you don't want to learn EJS from the get-go or if you don't want to be overwhelmed as a newcomer to MongoDB and Node.js, just don't take into account this part of the code. It is **NOT** used all over the place in the project.

Once you feel comfortable with Node.js and MongoDB, then you'll be ready for EJS. EJS is a templating tool that enables you to insert data from your database into .ejs files, which are then rendered into HTML. The simplest form of EJS would be a regular old HTML page, but with an .ejs extension (but of course, that would be pointless).

## The GET Method

Please keep in mind that using the GET method all over the place the way I do is just for the sake of convenience (I'm talking about the Create, Read, Update and Delete links on the main page of the site/app). I would not recommend it in something else than an exercise. Normally, you would use PUT, DELETE, etc.

I might improve this in the future.

## The Starting Point for this Project

The starting point for this exercise was [Programming Mentor's tutorial](http://programmingmentor.com/post/save-form-nodejs-mongodb/). The final result is now quite different. And given the important security issue and the outdated MongoDB 2.0, the code needed a major overhaul which makes it unrecognizable. Still, thank you, Programming Mentor! :-)

## Final Notes

I stumbled upon Steve Griffith's tutorials at a very late stage in my journey. I was impressed with the high quality of what he has to offer. On top of that he is an experienced teacher at Algonquin College in Ottawa:
